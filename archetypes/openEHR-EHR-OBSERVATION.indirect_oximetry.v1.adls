The aim is to consistently model a clinical concept, rather than to model device output ; devices are increasingly multi-functional and provide overlapping measurements which may need to be recorded using a number of discrete archetypes.

Waveforms should be recorded here when used to document quality of the blood gas measurement. In contrast, if used for primary diagnostic purposes e.g. of cardiac output, plesmythography should be recorded in the key associated clinical archetype - OBSERVATION.heart_rate-pulse.(en)">
