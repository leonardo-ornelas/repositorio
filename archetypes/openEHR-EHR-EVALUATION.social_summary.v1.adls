Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of social circumstances or experiences already captured within existing clinical systems into an archetyped format.

Use as a container archetype - to provide a common, queryable ENTRY archetype in which specific, detailed CLUSTER archetypes can be nested. Examples of appropriate CLUSTER archetypes may include, and are not limited to, relationships with others, social supports, living arrangements, employment, education and religion.

The use of the term 'social summary' varies enormously in practice. This archetype has been designed to allow the concepts that express social history in varying clincial contexts to be represented with the appropriate mix of re-useable archetypes.
