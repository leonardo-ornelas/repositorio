An alcohol consumption diary could be built up over time by recording the consumption of alcohol on multiple, sequential days - recording actual consumptions using the 'Specified Day' event for each daily entry.

A record of typical alcohol use during a period can be recorded by recording the amount of alcohol consumed using the 'Average use' event - the mean use over a specified period of time.

Data that might be used to assess the risk of alcohol abuse or dependence will be recorded using two archetypes: this OBSERVATION archetype (recording the repeatable observations/measurements)  and in the EVALUATION.alcohol_use_summary archetype (recording the summary and persisting data).

Binge drinking is not directly referred to in this archetype, yet this archetype will be a key resource used to support the identification of binge drinking through the accurate recording of the amount and frequency of drinking, triggers and social/cultureal context of consumption. The assessment of 'binge drinking' may be recorded as part of a 'Problem List'.">
