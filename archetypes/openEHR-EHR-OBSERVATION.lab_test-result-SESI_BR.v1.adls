A cumulative report is a view that is constructed from the results represented by multiple OBSERVATION archetypes.

This archetype is suitable for representation of general pathology test results, but not intended to cover full synoptic reports. For these, additional specialising archetypes are required to represent the data.">

Multi-analyte panels can be represented using templates or specialised archetypes.

More complex tests such as histopathology or microbiology should be represented using specialised archetypes where additional report content is required.

Will normally be reported back to the requesting clinician as one component within the context of an overall COMPOSITION-based report.">
