This detailed clinical model (DCM) has specifically been designed to avoid the need to use flags or terminology to express negation about any medication use within the health record. 

Exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the time of recording. For example: exclusion of use of coumarin on admission to hospital is only relevant at the time of recording, and is effectively obsolete if the subsequent diagnosis is deep venous thrombosis and the subject is commenced on heparin or coumarin.">
