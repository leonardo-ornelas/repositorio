			use = <"Use to record the subjective, narrative description of an individual's health story. If recorded directly by an individual/patient, this can be used within a personal health record. If recorded by a clinician this can be used as the 'History of Presenting Complaint' or 'Clinical History' of a consultation note within a health record.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical history within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Story' data element.

Use to record a simple narrative and/or as a container archetype - to provide a common, queryable ENTRY archetype framework which can be extended by the inclusion of additional, specific and detailed CLUSTER archetypes, each of which will describe the various aspects of the clinical history. Examples of history-related CLUSTER archetypes include CLUSTER.symptom (and specialisations) or CLUSTER.health_event.">
